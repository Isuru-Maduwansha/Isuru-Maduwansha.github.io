## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about creating custom CSS properties and how to work with them. I also learned about the :root pseudo-class, which has improved my HTML and CSS knowledge.

```css
:root{
   --font-base : "Figtree";
   --c-yellow : hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
   --c-white : hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
   --c-gray500 : hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
   --c-gray950 : hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll rebuild this with what I learn in futuer.
